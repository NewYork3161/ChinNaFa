            <img src="./img/LieTai.jpg" class="img-fluid" width="200" height="200">
            <p>Lei Tai is a traditional Chinese martial arts competition that has been around for over 2000 years. This competition is known to have several similarities with Pankration. In Lei Tai matches, the fighters engaged in ground grappling with few or no rules. The Lei Tai arena was an elevated fighting platform without any railings, where fighters used to participate in bare-knuckle martial arts tournaments with potentially fatal weapons. During sanctioned matches, a referee would preside over the platform while judges watched from the sides. The loser would be determined if they surrendered, were hindered, thrown, or forced off the stage.
               On the other hand, the winner would remain on the stage as its "owner" unless ousted by a stronger opponent. If no more challengers were left, they would become the champion. This ancient martial art can be traced back to at least the Qin Dynasty in China and is similar to Brazilian MMA.</p>

            <p>Chinese martial arts have had a significant impact on the development of indigenous martial arts in other countries. For instance, Chin Na techniques, rooted in Chinese martial arts, have been instrumental in shaping Aikido and Jujutsu in Japan and Hapkido in Korea. Interestingly, many of the original Chin Na techniques from Chinese martial arts share similarities with the grappling-based methods used in other forms of martial arts, such as Brazilian jiu-jitsu.</p>

People cherished so much passion for this entertainment that they would cover hundreds of miles to see the government-runned Jiaodi drama. In the Jiaodi Drama, two participants usually wear make-up before they perform in public. The basic features of wrestling came into being in this period. In 1970s, one piece of silk embroidery of Han dynasty was unearthed, which depicts two Jiaodi participants ready to fight each other.

A comprehensive art form embracing folk dance, folk music, acrobatics, martial art and magic emerged during this period, which was known as Baixi (literally mans variety show, Baixi is the counterpart of Yayue: the elegant music played in royal palace). Emperor Huan Wudi established a music organization named Yuefu at this period. Against the background of enhanced cultural and artistic exchange between middle and western China thanks to the opening of Silk Road, Baixi drama took in Jiaodi drama and prospered unprecedentedly. Royal families started to launch large-scaled Baixi performances also. The most renowned Jiaodi drama in this period is Mr Huang Of East Sea. Here goes the plot: In the end of Qin dynasty (221BC-206BC), a magician named Mr Huang went to East Sea to kill a white tiger. Unfortunately, his magic powers disappeared the moment the tiger jumped into him. Thus he was killed by the tiger. Featuring fixed figures, plots, conflictions and ending, this is thought to be the earliest drama in China, and Baixi is considered as the cradle of Chinese drama by experts.

Jiaodi game depicted in one tomb fresco During Jin dynasty (226-420), Jiaodi was named as Xiangpu. In Tang dynasty (618-907), the word Xiangpu and Jiaodi co-existed. The succeeding dynasties include Song (960-1276), Liao (907-1125), Jin (1115-1234), Yuan (1271-1368) witnessed its robust development. Xiangpu was divided into two categories: sport competition and entertainment performance during these three dynasties.　 During Tang and Song dynasties, Jiaodi drama or Xiangpu became a more widely spread entertainment activity. It appeared in various occasions such as royal palace, government officials' mansions, military camps and villages in the form of Baixi. Jiaodi was also one form of ancient martial art originated from Warring States period (475BC-222BC). In Han dynasty, it was deeply-rooted among the lower class. In North Song dynasty (960-1127), Xiangpu will be held once or twice per year in its capital, and females joined in this entertainment also. According to history record, there was female participants wearing collarless and short-sleeved costumes to perform Xiangpu in Kaifeng,Henan province, which caused a great sensation at that time, and people thronged to see this rare phenomenon. (In feudal society, women are not expected to reveal their body so much). Si Maguang, an important historian, wrote a letter to emperor to stop this behavior. Despite of his objection, female Xiangpu continued. In South Song dynasty (1127-1276), female Xiangpu performance functioned as a prelude to the male Xiangpu to attract more attention.

Jiaodi(Jiao li) and Xiangpu are two primitive forms of wrestling. Jiaodi came into being in primitive society as a physical fight form. Huang Di and Chi You, leaders of two rival tribes were fighting for the ruling of society at that time. Chi You was a brutal and cold-blooded man. Armed with two bull horns in the head, he was hard to defeat. Huang Di, a courageous and upright man, won the war in the end. Impressed by Chi You's fighting practice by wearing horns in the head, Huang Di preserved it in the form of drama: Chi You Drama. The performers will wear bull horns and fighting each other like bulls. During East Zhou period (770BC-256BC), Jiaodi prevailed, especially among the northern tribes.

            <img src="./img/JKO.jpg" class="img-fluid">
            <p>Jigoro Kano, the father of Judo and modern jiu-jitsu, acknowledges and profoundly respects Chinese martial arts for their ground fighting techniques. He credits Shaolin monk Chen Yuan-Bin for bringing the Chin Na techniques that would later become Jiu-Jitsu to Japan. It is said that during the Tokugawa period (1600-1867), Hichiromen Fukuno developed a method called YawaraRyoshinto, which included the principles of Ju (the principle of climbing down or non-resistance). Around the same time, Jushin Seiguchi founded a school emphasizing Ukemi art (specifically falling). These schools systematized their techniques and created the framework for Ju-Jitsu as an independent, unarmed fighting form.

                Around 1600, Chen-Yuan-Bin, a warrior Shaolin monk, arrived in Japan and taught a series of procedures based on roll-outs, volts, drifts, crafty movements of throwing down on the ground, and articulated and hit techniques. He trained ronin (samurai without a master) in hand-to-hand combat techniques, such as blows in vital points and articular techniques. The instructor of the Owari samurai clan noticed Chen-Yuan-Bin's skills, and he taught them what would later be known as Ju-Jitsu. Master Jigoro Kano accredited Chen-Yuan-Bin with this.
                
                In modern times, ju-jitsu has survived through disciplines adapted by modern masters to meet the requirements of contemporary life. Judo, created by Professor Jigoro Kano, and Aikido, created by O Sensei Morihei Ueshiba, are two examples of this. Several schools continue to practice Ju-Jitsu, such as TakedaRyu, Wa-Jutsu, Ju-Tai-Jutsu (within Ninjutsu Bujinkan), Goshinjutsu (Ju-jitsu for defense), and Kendo (the way of the sword).</p>

          <p>First published in 1936, this work represents primary source material of ancient combat techniques designed in a time of occupation and war, when the threat of lethal hand-to-hand combat was an ever-present reality for soldiers, those involved in law enforcement, and very often for the ordinary citizen. This is the seminal work in the field, written by the form’s founders, Liu Jinsheng and Zhao Jiang, as a training manual for the Police Academy of Zheijiang province. The intent of this translation is to provide authentic historical documentation for martial arts techniques that have been modified for use today in both competition and self-defense. Submission grappling is a technique in which fighters use locks, chokes, and breaking techniques to defeat their challengers in no-holds-barred matches. Chi Na Fa remains the most comprehensive explanation available of these Chinese grappling techniques, from which derive many current techniques. Renowned author and Brazillian jiu jitsu champion Tim Cartmell presents the book in a clear, compelling new translation.</p>
